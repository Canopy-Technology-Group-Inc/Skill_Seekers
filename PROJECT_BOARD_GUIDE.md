## 🎯 Overview

Our project board uses a **flexible, task-based approach** with 127 independent tasks across 10 categories. Pick any task, work on it, complete it, and move to the next!

## 📊 Custom Fields

The project board includes these custom fields:

### Workflow Stage (Primary - Use This!)
Our incremental development workflow:
- **📋 Backlog** - All available tasks (120 tasks) - Browse and discover
